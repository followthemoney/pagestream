# PageStream

Some scanners and PDF merge software results in a single merged PDF that has the
original document titles in the outline. The dutch government uses software like
this to respond to FOIA requests.

This module was created to split these FOIA requests by outline. The intent for
this module is to be able to split different kind streams. Be as certain as
possible of where to split, and be resistant to common errors.

Example usage:
```
pagestream --help
```
